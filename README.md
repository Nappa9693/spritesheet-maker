To use the code to create spritesheets:
* Install NodeJS which can be found [here](https://nodejs.org/en)
* Navigate to the parent directory where index.js resides.
* Run ```$node index.js```
* You will be prompted for the source directory where the images/sprites can be found, and the destination/filename for the spritesheet (be sure to include the file extension).
